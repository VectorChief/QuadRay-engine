QuadRay engine is a realtime raytracer project aimed at full SIMD utilization
on both ARM and x86 architectures. The efficient use of SIMD is achieved by
processing four rays at a time to match SIMD register width (hence the name).
The rendering core of the engine is written on a unified SIMD assembler,
allowing single assembler code to be compatible with different processor
architectures, thus reducing the need to maintain multiple parallel versions.

At present, Intel SSE2/AVX2 (32-bit x86 ISA) and ARM NEON (32-bit ARMv7 ISA)
are three primary targets although wider SIMD, 64-bit addressing along with
more available registers and other architectures can be supported by design.
Preliminary naming scheme for potential future targets as well as extended
base and SIMD register files can be found in core/config/rtarch.h file.
Instructions for resolving dependencies and building the binaries
for supported platforms can be found in the accompanying INSTALL file.
