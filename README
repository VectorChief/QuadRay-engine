QuadRay engine is a realtime raytracer project aimed at full SIMD utilization
on both ARM and x86 architectures. The efficient use of SIMD is achieved by
processing four rays at a time to match SIMD register width (hence the name).
At present Intel SSE (1 and 2) and ARM MPE (aka NEON) operating in 32-bit mode
are two primary targets, although wider SIMD can be supported by design.

The rendering core of the engine is written on a unified SIMD assembler,
allowing single assembler code to be compatible with different processor
architectures, thus reducing the need to maintain multiple parallel versions.

Zip archives for point releases (in Files/Downloads) are normally not updated,
although minor improvements and bug fixes are backported to the corresponding
branches and tags (in Code/Source). If there is a need to explore or work on
the earlier versions of the engine, select the appropriate branch and take
the snapshot of the repository (click Snapshot/Zip). Zip archive with the most
recent changes for that branch will be generated and downloaded on the fly.
