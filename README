QuadRay engine is a realtime raytracing project aimed at full SIMD utilization
on ARM, MIPS, Power and x86 architectures. The efficient use of SIMD is achieved
by processing four rays at a time to match SIMD register width (hence the name).
The rendering core of the engine is written on a unified SIMD assembler
allowing single assembler code to be compatible with different processor
architectures, thus reducing the need to maintain multiple parallel versions.

At present, Intel SSE/SSE2/SSE4 and AVX/AVX2/AVX-512 (32/64-bit x86 ISAs),
ARMv7 NEON/NEONv2, ARMv8:AArch32 NEON and AArch64 NEON (32/64-bit ARM ISAs),
MIPS 32/64-bit r5/r6 MSA and Power 32/64-bit VMX/VSX (little/big-endian ISAs)
are mostly implemented, although scalar SIMD subset, horizontal SIMD reductions,
wider SIMD vectors with zeroing/merging predicates in 3/4-operand instructions,
larger register files and other architectures are planned as future extensions
to current 2-operand (destination-as-1st-source) SPMD-driven vertical SIMD ISA.

Heap-address, SIMD-element sizes are 32/64-bit configurable on 64-bit targets.
All targets support FMA3 either natively or via higher-precision fpu-emulation.
All legacy targets support 128-bit SIMD with 8 registers (32-bit elements only).
All modern targets support 256-bit SIMD with 15 registers (x86, 2x128 on RISCs).
Select few targets support 512-bit SIMD with 15 registers (x86, 4x128 on Power).

The project comes with a test framework for Linux/GCC, Windows/VC++/TDM64-GCC.
Instructions for resolving dependencies and building the binaries
for supported platforms can be found in the accompanying INSTALL file.
