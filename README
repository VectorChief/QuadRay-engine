QuadRay engine is a realtime raytracer project aimed at full SIMD utilization
on both ARM and x86 architectures. The efficient use of SIMD is achieved by
processing four rays at a time to match SIMD register width (hence the name).

At present, Intel SSE2 (32-bit x86 ISA) and ARM NEON (32-bit ARMv7 ISA)
are two primary targets, although wider SIMD, 64-bit addressing along with
more available registers, and other architectures can be supported by design.
