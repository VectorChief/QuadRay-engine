QuadRay engine is a realtime raytracer project aimed at full SIMD utilization
on ARM, MIPS, Power and x86 architectures. The efficient use of SIMD is achieved
by processing four rays at a time to match SIMD register width (hence the name).
The rendering core of the engine is written in a unified SIMD assembler,
allowing single assembler code to be compatible with different processor
architectures, thus reducing the need to maintain multiple parallel versions.

At present, Intel SSE/SSE2/SSE4 and 256-bit AVX/AVX2 (32/64-bit x86 ISAs),
ARMv7 NEON/NEONv2, ARMv8:AArch32 NEON and AArch64 NEON (32/64-bit ARM ISAs),
MIPS 32/64-bit r5/r6 MSA and Power 32/64-bit VMX/VSX (little/big-endian ISAs)
are mostly implemented, although wider SIMD, 64-bit floating point along with
more available registers and other architectures can be supported by design.
Experimental 64/32-bit hybrid mode (compatible with native 64-bit ABI) is also
available on four major architectures for the original pure 32-bit ISA.

The project comes with a test framework, which can be compiled in Linux/GCC,
Maemo/scratchbox (N900 version) as well as Windows/VC++ 6.0 or later.
Instructions for resolving dependencies and building the binaries
for supported platforms can be found in the accompanying INSTALL file.
