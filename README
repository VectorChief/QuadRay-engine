QuadRay engine is a realtime raytracer project aimed at full SIMD utilization
on ARM, MIPS, Power and x86 architectures. The efficient use of SIMD is achieved
by processing four rays at a time to match SIMD register width (hence the name).
The rendering core of the engine is written on a unified SIMD assembler,
allowing single assembler code to be compatible with different processor
architectures, thus reducing the need to maintain multiple parallel versions.

At present, Intel SSE/SSE2/SSE4 and 256-bit AVX/AVX2 (32-bit x86/x32 ISAs),
ARMv7 NEON/NEONv2, ARMv8:AArch32 NEON and AArch64:ILP32 NEON (32-bit ARM ISAs),
MIPS32 r5/r6 MSA (little/big-endian) and 32-bit Power VMX/VSX (big-endian) ISAs
are fully supported, although wider SIMD, 64-bit addressing along with
more available registers and other architectures can be supported by design.
Preliminary naming scheme for potential future targets as well as extended
BASE and SIMD register files can be found in core/config/rtarch.h file.

The project comes with a test framework, which can be compiled in Linux/GCC,
Maemo/scratchbox (N900 version) as well as Windows/VC++ 6.0 or later.
Instructions for resolving dependencies and building the binaries
for supported platforms can be found in the accompanying INSTALL file.
