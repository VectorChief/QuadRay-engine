QuadRay engine is a realtime raytracer project aimed at full SIMD utilization
on both ARM and x86 architectures. The efficient use of SIMD is achieved by
processing four rays at a time to match SIMD register width (hence the name).
The rendering core of the engine is written in a unified SIMD assembler,
allowing single assembler code to be compatible with different processor
architectures, thus reducing the need to maintain multiple parallel versions.

At present, Intel SSE2 (32-bit x86 ISA) and ARM NEON (32-bit ARMv7 ISA)
are two primary targets, although wider SIMD, 64-bit addressing along with
more available registers, and other architectures can be supported by design.
Instructions for resolving dependencies and building the binaries
for supported platforms can be found in the accompanying INSTALL file.
