QuadRay engine is a realtime raytracer project aimed to fully utilize SIMD
on both ARM and x86 architectures. The efficient use of SIMD is achieved by
processing four rays at a time (hence the name) to match SIMD register width.
Initially Intel SSE (1 and 2) and ARM MPE (aka NEON) are primary targets.

The rendering core of the engine is written on a unified SIMD assembler which
allows a single assembler code to be compatible with different processor
architectures thus reducing the need to maintain multiple parallel versions.
