QuadRay engine is a realtime raytracer project aimed to fully utilize SIMD
on both ARM and x86 architectures. The efficient use of SIMD is achieved by
processing four rays at a time (hence the name) to match SIMD register width.
Initially Intel SSE (1 and 2) and ARM MPE (aka NEON) are primary targets.
