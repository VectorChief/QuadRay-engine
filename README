QuadRay engine is a realtime raytracer project aimed at full SIMD utilization
on both ARM and x86 architectures. The efficient use of SIMD is achieved by
processing four rays at a time to match SIMD register width (hence the name).
At present Intel SSE (1 and 2) and ARM MPE (aka NEON) operating in 32-bit mode
are two primary targets, although wider SIMD can be supported by design.

The rendering core of the engine is written on a unified SIMD assembler,
allowing single assembler code to be compatible with different processor
architectures, thus reducing the need to maintain multiple parallel versions.

Minor improvements and bug-fixes are normally backported to older versions
of the engine sitting on the corresponding branches in the repository.
Once enough changes have been accumulated, zip archives for point releases
(in Files/Downloads section if present) are updated along with the tags.
